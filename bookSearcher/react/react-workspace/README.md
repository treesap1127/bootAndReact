# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

assets 폴더 : 컴파일이 필요한 img 파일들을 요구 - public 파일은 정적 메소드 중 컴파일이 필요없는 index나 ico ㅇㅇ
components 폴더 : 함수 집합소
constants : properties 처럼 상수용도로 사용하면 될듯
hooks : api 호출 하는 곳	services는 컴포넌트에서 사용할 함수 적용 
pages : 각 페이지에 대한 링크 연결시 components 연결을 수행-> /~ -> 이파일 실행(랜더링 할 페이지)
services: api 호출이지만 RestApi 라고 본다면 services는 컴포넌트에서 사용할 수 있는거네..
style : -> css
utile : 사용 함수 ㅇㅇ
